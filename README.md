Cheech’s Pizza Online Ordering Page

You have been hired by Cheech’s Pizza to develop an online ordering form. Cheech would like to be able to have a page whereby customers can enter in their name and phone number, how many pizzas they would like to order and choose from a drop down selection which type of pizza they would like. For now, a customer can only order one type of pizza. (I know, weird, but it makes this assignment easier)

Develop a page that follows these requirements:
Create the page using Bootstrap and Bootstrap form classes
Include a text box for name, phone number
Create a selection box which allows a customer to order 1 to 10 pizzas.
This looks like a great place for javascript. Use javascript to create a loop that prints the selection list choices.
Create a selection box which allows a customer to order the type of pizza
Create an array of a minimum of 5 pizza types
Use javascript to write the selection items in the selection list.
If Bob adds a new pizza flavor, all that he should have to do is add the new pizza type to the array and the selection list will populate based on the javascript code, and not by having to also manually edit the html
When the customer has entered all the data, the customer will click a order button. There should be an addEventListener that produces a summary of the order
Display somewhere on the form
the customers name and phone number
the number of pizzas they ordered
the type of pizza they ordered
the sub total of the pizza order
the tax charged (7.6%)
the total of the order
The page look professional and polished
