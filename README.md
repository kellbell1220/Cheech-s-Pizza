Cheech’s Pizza Online Ordering Page

You have been hired by Cheech’s Pizza to develop an online ordering form. Cheech would like to be able to have a page whereby customers can enter in their name and phone number, how many pizzas they would like to order and choose from a drop down selection which type of pizza they would like. For now, a customer can only order one type of pizza. (I know, weird, but it makes this assignment easier)

Develop a page that follows these requirements: Create the page using Bootstrap and Bootstrap form classes Include a text box for name, phone number Create a selection box which allows a customer to order 1 to 10 pizzas. This looks like a great place for javascript. Use javascript to create a loop that prints the selection list choices. Create a selection box which allows a customer to order the type of pizza Create an array of a minimum of 5 pizza types Use javascript to write the selection items in the selection list. If Bob adds a new pizza flavor, all that he should have to do is add the new pizza type to the array and the selection list will populate based on the javascript code, and not by having to also manually edit the html When the customer has entered all the data, the customer will click a order button. There should be an addEventListener that produces a summary of the order Display somewhere on the form the customers name and phone number the number of pizzas they ordered the type of pizza they ordered the sub total of the pizza order the tax charged (7.6%) the total of the order The page look professional and polished
